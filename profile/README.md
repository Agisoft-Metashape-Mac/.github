## What is Agisoft Metashape for Mac?

Agisoft Metashape for Mac is a **standalone photogrammetric software** solution designed to create professional-quality 3D spatial data from digital images. Built for macOS, it enables photographers, surveyors, researchers, and visual effects artists to generate detailed 3D models, textured meshes, georeferenced orthomosaics, and dense point clouds.

The software leverages advanced algorithms to process images automatically, supporting both aerial (captured by drones) and close-range photography. Key features include:

- **Dense Point Cloud Generation** for accurate spatial representation.
- **Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Digital Terrain Model (DTM)** creation.
- **High-Quality Texture Mapping** for realistic model surfaces.
- **Measurement Tools** for calculating distances, areas, and volumes.
- **Python Scripting Support** for automation and custom workflows.

**Agisoft Metashape Mac** is engineered to deliver high performance on **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)** and Intel-based Macs, fully optimized for **macOS Ventura and Sonoma**. It handles large datasets efficiently, making it a trusted tool in industries like archaeology, engineering, and virtual reality development. Its intuitive interface guides users through the workflow from photo alignment to final export, ensuring precision and reliability for critical projects.
